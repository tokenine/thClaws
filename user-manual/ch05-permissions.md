# Chapter 5 — Permissions

thClaws runs tools on your behalf: it edits files, runs shell commands,
fetches URLs, and invokes MCP servers. **Permissions** decide which of
those happen without your nod.

## Permission modes

| Mode | Behaviour | How to set |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | All tools run automatically. Agents can chain edits and bash calls without interruption. | `/permissions auto` or `--accept-all` |
| `ask` | Mutating tools (Edit, Write, Bash) prompt for approval before running. Read-only tools run automatically. | `/permissions ask` or `--permission-mode ask` |
| `plan` | Read-only exploration — all mutating tools are blocked. Use it to survey a codebase before doing any work. See [Chapter 18](ch18-plan-mode.md). | `/plan enter` (separate slash command — not via `/permissions`) |
| `linegated` | Approval prompts route to your LINE chat on the phone instead of asking on the desktop. See [Chapter 21](ch21-line-and-browser-chat.md). | Auto-activates when the LINE bridge connects (pre-LINE mode is stashed and restored on disconnect). If you overrode with `/permissions auto` and want it back without disconnecting LINE, run `/permissions linegated` while the bridge is still connected — not persisted to `settings.json` (runtime state only). |

> **While `linegated` is active, the surface you typed from doesn't
> matter.** Every approval prompt routes to LINE — whether you typed
> in the Terminal tab, Chat tab, REPL, or the LINE bubble itself. The
> approver is a process-wide singleton (`shared_session.rs:1842`
> swaps `state.approver` wholesale when the bridge connects) and has
> no awareness of which surface originated the tool call. Design
> rationale: your phone is the single "approval inbox" while paired,
> so someone typing in via LINE can't trick you into approving their
> `Bash` thinking it was yours. If browser chat (`/chat`) is also
> open, the browser modal wins — better UX than LINE Quick Reply
> chips for long argument previews.
>
> To bypass while LINE remains paired, run `/permissions auto` (no
> prompts anywhere) or `/permissions ask` (prompt locally on the
> desktop). Both also pull `state.approver` back to the desktop
> approver, so even Ask-mode prompts surface in the Terminal /
> Chat tab rather than continuing to push to your phone — the LINE
> bridge connection itself stays up so the sidebar pill stays green
> and `/permissions linegated` can swap back. Alternatively,
> disconnect LINE from the GUI's LINE Connect modal to restore your
> pre-LINE mode in one step.

Set the mode at startup:

```bash
thclaws --cli --permission-mode ask      # explicit
thclaws --cli --accept-all               # alias for --permission-mode auto
```

Or mid-session:

```
❯ /permissions auto
permissions: auto

❯ /permissions ask
permissions: ask
```

## What the prompt looks like

In `ask` mode, when the agent wants to run (say) `Bash`:

```
[tool: Bash: npm install express] ?
 [y] yes   [n] no   [yolo] approve everything for this session
```

- `y` — approve this one call.
- `n` — deny it; the model gets `tool was denied` as the result and
  usually revises its approach.
- `yolo` — flip to `auto` for the rest of the session. The tool
  runs and every subsequent tool call runs without asking.

#### What `yolo` is

`yolo` ("you only live once") is a shortcut for "approve everything
for this session." It's the same thing the GUI's **Allow for
session** button does. When you type `yolo` (CLI) or click the
button (GUI), thClaws:

- runs the tool that was waiting (pass through)
- flips the runtime mode to `auto` for the remainder of the current
  session — every later tool call runs without prompting
- sets a per-session "yolo" flag inside the approver — the flag is
  **not** persisted to `settings.json`; it's runtime state only

The flag is automatically cleared when:

- you start a new session (`/new`, the GUI's "New session" button,
  or restarting thclaws)
- you load an older session via `/load <id>` or `--resume`
- the LINE bridge disconnects (if it was active)
- you run `/permissions ask` to return to per-call prompting

If you want `auto` to stick across restart, use `/permissions auto`
(persists to `settings.json`) or `--accept-all` instead — these are
the same thing (`/permissions yolo` is an alias of
`/permissions auto`), but they save to disk. The `yolo` answer at a
prompt is deliberately session-scoped only.

**The filesystem sandbox and tool allowlist still apply.** `yolo`
only skips the approval prompt — it doesn't disable the filesystem
sandbox (see below) and doesn't override `allowedTools` /
`disallowedTools` in `settings.json`. Tools on the disallow list
remain blocked even under `yolo`.

A `⚠` marker appears alongside commands that look destructive —
`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl … | sh`, `dd`, `mkfs`, etc. — so you look
twice before typing `y`.

## Read-only vs mutating defaults

| Read-only (auto in `ask` mode) | Mutating (prompts in `ask` mode) |
|---|---|
| `Ls`, `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` | `Write`, `Edit` |
| `AskUser`, `EnterPlanMode`, `ExitPlanMode` | `Bash` |
| `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskGet`, `TaskList` | `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` |
|   | `Task` (spawn subagent) |
|   | All MCP tools |

The intent: looking at your code is always free; changing your code,
running commands, or reaching the network is a choice.

## Fine-grained allow / deny lists

For project or user config, the `permissions` field in
`.thclaws/settings.json` (or `~/.config/thclaws/settings.json`) accepts
two shapes:

### Simple mode string

```json
{ "permissions": "auto" }
```

### Claude Code-style allow/deny

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Write", "Edit", "Bash(*)"],
    "deny":  ["WebFetch"]
  }
}
```

- `allow` entries run without prompting (implicit `auto` for these).
- `deny` entries never run; attempts return an error to the model.
- `Bash(*)` allows all bash commands; `Bash(git *)` restricts the allow
  to git commands only (glob matching on the command string).

The flat form works too:

```json
{
  "permissions": "auto",
  "allowedTools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep", "Glob"],
  "disallowedTools": ["WebFetch", "WebSearch"]
}
```

## CLI flags for a single run

```bash
thclaws --cli \
  --permission-mode auto \
  --allowed-tools "Read,Write,Edit,Bash" \
  --disallowed-tools "WebFetch"
```

Flags override settings files for that process only.

## The filesystem sandbox {#sandbox-filesystem}

Independent of the permission prompt: **file tools are always scoped to
the working directory.** Paths that escape via `..`, absolute paths
pointing outside, or symlink traversal are rejected before the tool
runs — regardless of permission mode. This is the guard that makes
`yolo` less scary.

If you want the agent to touch something outside the current directory,
either launch thClaws from the parent directory (which widens the
sandbox), or copy / symlink the file in first.

## OS-level Bash sandbox (`bash.sandbox`) {#bash-sandbox}

The filesystem sandbox above scopes the **file tools** (Read/Write/Edit).
It does **not** confine what a `Bash` command writes — `echo x > ~/secret`
or `python -c "open('/abs','w')"` runs the shell directly, so an absolute
path escapes. A `pre_tool_use` hook (Chapter 13) can *screen* commands, but
screening a string is defeatable by obfuscation (`$(printf …)`, `eval`).

`bash.sandbox` adds a **hard, OS-enforced** boundary around the Bash
subprocess (and everything it spawns) — the kernel blocks the write, so it
holds no matter how the command is written:

```json
{
  "bash": {
    "sandbox": "workspace",
    "sandbox_write_paths": ["/some/extra/dir"],
    "sandbox_deny_read": ["~/secret-notes"]
  }
}
```

| Mode | Writable | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace` *(default)* | the workspace + `/tmp` + package-manager caches (`~/.cache`, `~/.npm`, `~/.cargo`, …) | normal dev — `pip`/`npm`/`cargo` still work |
| `strict` | the workspace + `/tmp` only | untrusted runs; breaks tools that cache in `$HOME` |
| `off` | everything | opt out of confinement |

**This is on by default** (`workspace`). To turn it off, set
`{ "bash": { "sandbox": "off" } }`. If a legitimate command needs to write
somewhere outside the workspace + caches, add it to `sandbox_write_paths`
rather than disabling confinement entirely.

In `workspace` and `strict`, reads of secret dotfiles (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`,
`~/.gnupg`, cloud creds, `~/.config/thclaws`) are **denied** too. Enforced
by macOS Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) and, on Linux, **Landlock** (an LSM needing no
user namespace, so it works on stock Ubuntu 24.04 where `bubblewrap` is blocked
by AppArmor; bwrap is the fallback). The confiner is **probed at runtime** — if
it can't actually enforce on this host, thClaws logs a loud one-time warning and
falls back to command-screening only **rather than breaking your commands**. So
turning the mode on is always safe: it either confines, or runs
unconfined-with-warning. It applies to **subagent and workflow** Bash
identically. Notes: v1 is **filesystem-only** (no network egress control), and
the Linux/Landlock path is **write-confinement only** (secret-read masking is
macOS-only for now).

> Layering: the `pre_tool_use` hook (soft policy/audit, Chapter 13) runs
> first and can deny; `bash.sandbox` is the hard floor under it.

## MCP stdio spawn allowlist

MCP stdio servers are subprocesses spawned from a JSON config file
that may have been cloned from an untrusted repo (`.thclaws/mcp.json`
or similar — see [Chapter 14](ch14-mcp.md)). Because the `command`
field is an arbitrary binary path, thClaws gates every **first-time**
spawn through a separate approval:

```
[mcp] New MCP stdio server wants to spawn:
      name:    filesystem-mcp
      command: npx
      args:    @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp

This will run the binary with your user privileges. Only
approve if you trust the MCP config that requested it.
Approve and remember? [y/N]
```

A yes persists the `command` string into
`~/.config/thclaws/mcp_allowlist.json`; future spawns of the same
command go through without prompting. The allowlist is keyed on the
`command` field only — changing args doesn't re-trigger the prompt,
so be deliberate when approving general-purpose runners like `npx`
or `python`.

**Headless contexts** (CI, GUI with no controlling TTY) fail closed
unless you explicitly set `THCLAWS_MCP_ALLOW_ALL=1` in a trusted
environment. Don't set that var on a shared machine or via a project
`.env` file — the dotenv loader blocks it for exactly that reason.

## Per-agent overrides

Agent Teams and the `Task` sub-agent tool can set their own
`permissionMode` in the agent definition file — useful for letting a
"reviewer" agent run read-only even when the lead is in `auto`. See
Chapter 15 and Chapter 17.
