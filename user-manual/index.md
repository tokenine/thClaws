# thClaws User Manual

A native-Rust AI agent workspace with CLI and desktop GUI. This manual

teams.

## Conventions used in this manual

- `❯` is the REPL prompt; what follows on that line is what **you** type.
- `$` is a shell prompt outside thClaws.
- `[tool: Bash: …]` / `[tokens: Xin/Yout · Ts]` lines show what thClaws prints back.
- Code fences without a language are terminal output; fences with a language (`rust`, `json`, `bash`) are files you write or commands you run.
- **Bold** inside a command label indicates a required input (e.g. **name**).
- Every chapter is self-contained — skip around freely.
