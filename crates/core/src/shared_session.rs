//! Shared in-process agent session that backs both the GUI's Terminal
//! and Chat tabs. One Agent, one Session, one history. Both tabs send
//! input through `ShellInput` and subscribe to `ViewEvent` broadcasts —
//! so typing in either tab contributes to the same conversation, and
//! /load replays the same transcript into both views.
//!
//! Only compiled with the `gui` feature because the previous
//! Terminal-tab REPL ran as a separate `--cli` PTY child; the
//! standalone CLI (`thclaws --cli`) is unchanged.
