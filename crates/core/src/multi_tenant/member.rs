//! dev-plan/45 A2: per-member attribution for gateway billing.
//!
//! In multiuser `--serve` every member's turn runs under a task-local
//! member id (established next to the workdir scope in
//! `shared_session::drive_turn_stream`). Outbound HTTP that can hit the
//! thClaws gateway attaches it as the `X-Thclaws-Member` header via
//! [`attach_member`], so the gateway can (a) record
//! `usage_events.member_id` and (b) enforce a per-(workspace, member)
//! daily cap — closing the "one guest drains the whole workspace cap"
//! fairness gap.
//!
//! The header is advisory for billing attribution, not an auth channel:
//! the gateway still authenticates the workspace by its gateway key.
//! Outside a member scope (desktop, single-tenant) requests are
//! untouched.
