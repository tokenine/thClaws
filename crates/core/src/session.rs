//! Session persistence.
//!
//! A session is a saved conversation: metadata + message history stored as
//! append-only JSONL. Sessions live under `~/.local/share/thclaws/sessions/`
//! (XDG data dir convention) as individual `.jsonl` files, one per session id.
//!
//! File format (Claude Code style):
//! - First line: metadata header `{"type":"header","id":...,"model":...,"cwd":...,"created_at":...}`
//! - Subsequent lines: message events `{"type":"user"|"assistant"|"system","content":[...],"timestamp":N}`
//!
//! Design choices:
//! - Session ids are derived from a nanosecond timestamp, so they're unique
//!   and naturally sort chronologically.
//! - `sync()` only appends new messages since `last_saved_count`.
//! - `load()` reads the JSONL and reconstructs the full `Session`.
//! - `SessionStore` is just a directory. No db, no lock file.

/// M6.24 BUG M4: serialize concurrent JSONL writes via OS-level
/// advisory file lock. Pre-fix two thClaws processes against the
/// same project session dir could interleave bytes mid-line because
/// POSIX `O_APPEND` is per-write atomic only ≤ PIPE_BUF (~4 KB);
/// tool_use lines with large content easily exceed that. With M6.19
/// H1's per-line skip-with-warning fix in place, the practical
/// impact dropped from "session disappears" to "occasional warning
/// + dropped corrupt line" — but corrupt lines are still corrupt
/// data. Locking eliminates the interleave entirely. Acquire
/// exclusive lock before each write; release at scope end via Drop.
///
/// ## Issue #90: Windows `os error 5` on lock acquisition
///
/// The open call MUST include `.read(true)`. On Windows, `append(true)`
/// alone produces a handle with the access mask
/// `FILE_GENERIC_WRITE & !FILE_WRITE_DATA` — i.e. `FILE_APPEND_DATA +
/// FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES + ...`, no `GENERIC_READ`. The Win32
/// `LockFileEx` API the `fs2` crate calls under the hood requires the
/// file handle to have `GENERIC_READ` or `GENERIC_WRITE` access; an
/// append-only handle fails the access check and returns
/// `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` (os error 5). Symptom on Windows: every
/// session save fails with `save failed: config error: session lock:
/// Access is denied. (os error 5)`, JSONL files end up zero bytes,
/// session restore shows empty history. POSIX `flock` doesn't have
/// this requirement, so macOS / Linux work fine with append-only.
/// Adding `.read(true)` fixes Windows without any behavior change on
/// POSIX. See <https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/90>.
