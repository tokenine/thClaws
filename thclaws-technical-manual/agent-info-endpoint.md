# `GET /v1/agent/info` — capability snapshot

Read-only endpoint that returns this daemon's capability snapshot —
skills, MCP servers, model catalogue, version, optional external
URL, feature flags. Used by orchestrators that treat thClaws as a
sovereign agent peer, so they can show what a daemon is configured
with without having pushed any of it.

For the corresponding *invocation* endpoint, see
[`agent-endpoint.md`](agent-endpoint.md) (`POST /agent/run`). For the
OpenAI-compatible chat surface, see [`openai-api.md`](openai-api.md).

## Why this exists

An orchestrator that provisions a daemon's workspace already knows
what it put there. One that merely *reaches* a daemon over HTTPS —
someone else's pod, a cloud VPS, a laptop — does not: it doesn't
manage that daemon's toolkit. To still show "this agent has these
skills" in a UI, poll `GET /v1/agent/info` periodically and cache the
snapshot.

The endpoint is also useful for operators verifying a fresh pod
("does the daemon I just spun up see my skills?") and for any
external tooling that needs to enumerate capabilities before
dispatching work.

## Request

```http
GET /v1/agent/info
Authorization: Bearer <THCLAWS_API_TOKEN>
```

No body, no query params. Pure read.

### Field reference

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | string | `Cargo.toml` package version. |
| `git_sha` | string | Short commit hash at build time, or `"unknown"` if the build environment had no git. |
| `git_dirty` | bool | `true` when the working tree had uncommitted changes at build time. |
| `build_profile` | string | `"debug"` or `"release"`. |
| `workspace_dir` | string | Daemon's CWD at start. For a pod that's typically `/workspace`. For a locally-spawned subprocess it's whatever the parent set. |
| `skills[]` | array | Same shape `SkillStore::discover()` produces. `source` is bucketed into `"builtin" \| "user" \| "plugin" \| "project"`. |
| `mcp_servers[]` | array | Configured MCP servers (config + plugin contributions, name-deduped). `command` is the spawn command summary or the URL (for HTTP-transport servers). `tool_count` is **`null` in v1** — counting tools requires spawning each server, which is too expensive for an info endpoint. The field is reserved for a future enrichment pass that populates it post-first-run. |
| `model_capabilities.default_model` | string | `AppConfig.model` — the daemon's configured default. |
| `model_capabilities.available_models[]` | array | Every chat-capable model id in the effective catalogue (cache layer + baseline, deduped, sorted). |
| `model_capabilities.supports_streaming` | bool | Always `true` in v1; reserved for future fallback signaling. |
| `model_capabilities.supports_x_callback` | bool | Always `true` in v1. |
| `model_capabilities.supports_agent_run` | bool | Always `true` in v1. |
| `external_access` | object \| null | Populated from `$THCLAWS_EXTERNAL_URL` (operator-set at daemon launch). `null` when unset — the UI then falls back to the OpenAI-compatible base URL. |
| `features.agent_info` | bool | `true` since dev-plan/26 Phase A. |
| `features.agent_run` | bool | `true` since dev-plan/25 Phase A. |
| `features.chat_completions` | bool | `true` since dev-plan/19. |
| `features.x_callback` | bool | `true` since dev-plan/23. |

Unknown fields a caller doesn't recognize should be ignored
(forward-compat — we may add fields like `policies[]`, `plugins[]`,
or `version_capabilities` in later iterations).

## Caching

The handler caches the snapshot for **30 seconds**. A dashboard that
fans out to N daemons on every refresh shouldn't melt them. The cache
is process-global (one slot per daemon, not per-caller) — back-to-back
polls within the window return the same content.

If you need an unconditional fresh read, wait 30s or restart the
daemon. There's no `?force=1` query param by design — operators
have other tools (curl + restart) for diagnostic forcing.

## Auth

Same Bearer extractor as `/v1/chat/completions` and `/agent/run`.
Three modes via `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN`:

- Unset → endpoint returns 404 (API disabled).
- `disable-auth` → no header required (loopback-only; enforced at
  server start).
- `<value>` → `Authorization: Bearer <value>` with constant-time
  compare.

## Error codes

| HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | Success (cached or freshly built). |
| `401` | Bearer token mismatch. |
| `404` | `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` unset — `/v1/*` is disabled on this daemon. |

The endpoint has no body validation, so there's no `400` path.
Server errors return `500` only if the underlying skill scan or
catalogue load throws (very unlikely — both are reads from files
the daemon already loaded at startup).

## Worked example

```sh
# Start the daemon
export THCLAWS_API_TOKEN=secret-xyz
export THCLAWS_EXTERNAL_URL=https://agent.example.com
thclaws --serve --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 8443

# Poll capability info
curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer secret-xyz' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8443/v1/agent/info | jq .

# Returns the snapshot shape above. Add a skill to ~/.thclaws/skills/
# and re-poll within 30s → SAME response (cache). Wait 30s or
# restart → fresh response reflecting the new skill.
```

## Implementation pointers

- Handler + caching: [`crates/core/src/api_v1/info.rs`](../thclaws/crates/core/src/api_v1/info.rs)
- Skill source classification: `classify_skill_source()` in the same file.
- Cache: `tokio::sync::Mutex<OnceLock<Option<Cached>>>`, TTL = 30s.
- Tests: 4 unit tests in the same module — covers source classification, snapshot structure, cache identity within TTL, `THCLAWS_EXTERNAL_URL` env round-trip.
