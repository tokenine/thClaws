//!   3. `~/.config/thclaws/settings.json` (user)
//!   4. Compiled-in defaults (credential-aware — see `preferred_default_model`)
//!
//! The user-global `~/.claude/settings.json` is deliberately NOT a model
//! source: importing Claude Code's `model` (e.g. a `…[1m]` alias thClaws
//! can't route) silently overrode the credential-aware default and left
//! users on a provider they never chose. Project-level `.claude/settings.json`
