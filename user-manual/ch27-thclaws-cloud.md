# Chapter 27 — thClaws.cloud

thClaws.cloud is the catalog + hosted runtime for thClaws agents. It
turns the **folder-is-an-agent** model (Chapter 8) into something you
can browse, publish, install on someone else's machine, or rent a
hosted workspace for. From your desktop thClaws, the cloud feels like
git for AI agents — paste a CLI token once in Settings, then every
catalog op (`/cloud get`, `/cloud publish`, `/cloud list`, …) runs as
a slash command inside an open thClaws session.

> **What this chapter covers (client side).** Browsing the catalog,
> publishing your own agents, getting agents into a local folder, and
> the new `agent.{name, description, uuid}` block in
> `settings.json`. The operator-side runbook for running your own

> and the workspace-private `thclaws-cloud/` source tree.

## The folder-is-an-agent model — recap

Anywhere thClaws runs, an **AI agent is a folder**. Three files at the
root of that folder make it complete:

- `AGENTS.md` — the agent's instructions (system prompt + persona).
- `manifest.json` — catalog metadata (slug, license, icon, tags). Only
  needed to publish.
- `./.thclaws/` — local state (settings, KMS, sessions, memory).

When you `cd` into the folder and run thClaws, you're "running that
agent". When you publish, the catalog packages those files into a
tarball; when someone else runs `/cloud get <slug>` from inside their
own thClaws session, they get the same folder. The cloud is just a
way to move folders between machines.

## Setting the catalog URL + a CLI token

Two things bind your desktop to a catalog server:

1. **Cloud URL** — `settings.json::cloud.url`. Defaults to the public
   instance (`https://thclaws.cloud`); point at `http://localhost` or
   your own self-hosted instance by overriding it.
2. **CLI token** — a `thc_…` string from the catalog dashboard, stored
   in the OS keychain (never in `settings.json`).

Settings → **thClaws.cloud** has fields for both. Paste the URL, paste
the token you mint at your dashboard (**+ New token**), hit Save —
every slash command in the rest of this chapter works immediately.

The token never goes through a shell argument or environment variable —
the GUI stores it directly in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain / Windows
Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service), and every catalog request
sends it as a Bearer header from inside the engine process. No `ps`
or shell-history leak.

> **Why no CLI subcommand?** Earlier releases had a
> `thclaws cloud login --token …` flow. Removed because tokens
> threaded through `argv` ended up in shell histories and any
> `ps`-style tool dump. Settings UI + keychain is the only way now.
> Running any old `thclaws cloud …` command prints an error that
> points at the new flow.

## Browsing the catalog

From inside any thClaws session (REPL or Chat tab):

```
❯ /cloud status
thClaws.cloud — https://thclaws.cloud (token: ✓ stored)

❯ /cloud list
- hello-world           v0.1.0  Hello-world demo agent (jimmy)
- legal-doc-reviewer    v0.4.2  Reviews contracts paragraph-by-paragraph (acme)
- weekly-research       v1.0.0  Saturday-morning newsletter writer (rin)
...

❯ /cloud list --mine
- weekly-research       v1.0.0  Saturday-morning newsletter writer (you)
```

Each row is a single agent in the catalog. The slug is what you pass
to `/cloud get`.

## Installing an agent into a folder

`/cloud get` always installs into the **current session's working
directory**. The typical flow:

```bash
# 1. From a shell — make an empty folder for the agent and cd into it.
mkdir my-hello && cd my-hello

# 2. Start a thClaws session there.
thclaws            # GUI default; --cli for the REPL
```

Then inside the session:

```
❯ /cloud get hello-world
Downloading hello-world (v0.1.0) …
Extracted to /Users/jimmy/my-hello/
  ✓ AGENTS.md
  ✓ manifest.json
  ✓ skills/greet.md
Done. /reload to pick up the new AGENTS.md.
```

The engine downloads the tarball, extracts every file into the cwd, and
the next `/reload` reads the new `AGENTS.md`. No shell tab-out needed.

### The folder-safety check

`/cloud get` refuses to overwrite a non-empty folder unless the folder
already holds the **same** agent (matched by UUID, see below). The
check works like this:

| Target folder state | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Empty | Fresh install. |
| Has `AGENTS.md` / `manifest.json` with a matching `agent.uuid` | Safe update — overwrites in place, preserves your `.thclaws/` session state. |
| Has `AGENTS.md` / `manifest.json` with a **mismatched** UUID | Abort. The folder belongs to another agent — `/cloud unbind` first, or use a different folder. |
| Other random files (notes, scratch, etc.) | Abort — install into an empty folder instead. |

This is intentional — it prevents a typo from clobbering an
in-progress agent or someone else's work in the same directory. The
slash surface has no `--force` override on purpose; just `/cloud get`
into a fresh, empty directory when in doubt.

## Publishing an agent

When you've built an agent in a folder and want it in the catalog,
start a thClaws session in that folder and use the slash command:

```
❯ /cloud publish              # uploads the cwd
```

`/cloud publish` does three things:

1. **Tar + gzip** the folder. Secrets, sessions, KMS pages, and the
   `./.thclaws/` state directory are stripped automatically — you
   can re-publish daily without leaking conversation history.
2. **Upload** to the catalog using your CLI token.
3. **Stamp the agent identity back into `settings.json`** (see the
   next section).

If `manifest.json` is missing or invalid, publish aborts with a clear
error. Minimum required fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `version`.

## Agent identity in `settings.json`

A new top-level `agent` block in `./.thclaws/settings.json` carries
this folder's catalog identity:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "my-research-bot",
    "name": "My Research Bot",
    "description": "Saturday-morning newsletter writer",
    "uuid": "1f9c1d70-3a26-43c4-9c40-1b1b6e3e3a01"
  }
}
```

- **id / name / description** — copied from `manifest.json` at publish
  time. Used by the catalog UI and by `/cloud get`'s safety check.
- **uuid** — assigned by the catalog the **first** time you publish
  from this folder, written back into `settings.json`. Subsequent
  publishes hit the same catalog row (version bump). The UUID is what
  `/cloud get` matches against to decide "is this folder the same
  agent?"

You normally don't edit this by hand. The GUI Settings → **Agent
identity** panel lets you tweak `name` / `description` (handy before
publishing — the description shows up in catalog listings) but
intentionally hides `uuid`.

### Forking a downloaded agent

If you `/cloud get`-ed someone else's agent and want to fork it under
your own name, from inside the agent's folder session:

```
❯ /cloud unbind            # clears settings.json::agent.uuid
❯ # in the same session: edit AGENTS.md, manifest.json — change `id` to something free
❯ /cloud publish           # gets a fresh UUID
```

Without `/cloud unbind`, the next publish would try to update the
original author's catalog row (and fail with a permission error — the
catalog gates publishes by author).

## Visibility — public / unlisted / private

Every published agent has a **visibility** setting (three values):

| Visibility | Who can see / install it |
|---|---|
| `public` | Everyone — shows in `/browse`, the `/a/<slug>` page, installable with `/cloud get`. **Superadmin review only** (a normal author can't self-promote to public). |
| `unlisted` (default) | Anyone with the **link** — hidden from `/browse`, but the `/a/<slug>` page works and `/cloud get <slug>` installs. The share-link default for self-published agents. |
| `private` | Only the **author** and root |

New agents from a verified (non-superadmin) user publish as **`unlisted`
by default** — reachable by sharing the page link, not listed in the
public catalog. A `private` agent is hidden from every path (list, detail,
`/cloud get`, fork all **404** — not 403, so private slugs aren't
enumerable).

**Changing visibility** — open your agent's page on the web
(`https://thclaws.cloud/a/<slug>`); a toggle appears when you're the
owner (or root). An author may flip between `private` and `unlisted`
freely; **promoting to `public` is superadmin-only** (else 403). There is *no* desktop
`/cloud` verb for this — it's web-only (it calls
`PATCH /api/agents/<slug>/visibility` under the hood). Use `private`
for agents still in beta/testing, or ones you want to share with just
your own team before going public.

## Hosted workspaces (rent, don't install)

If you don't want to install agents on your laptop, the catalog also
runs them as **hosted workspaces** — one container per workspace, a
URL you open in any browser, a real chat UI backed by the same engine
you'd run locally.

From the catalog web UI:

1. Browse to an agent's detail page.
2. Click *Install on hosted* and pick (or create) a **ready** workspace.
3. The catalog installs the agent into that existing workspace —
   **overwriting** its current agent definition — and redirects you to the
   chat UI at `/u/<your-handle>/<slug>/` (the handle
   is a stable per-user id, so two users can each have a workspace named
   `<slug>` without their URLs colliding).

Hosted workspaces support both BYOK (paste your own provider keys
under *Settings → Hosted keys*) and the **thClaws.cloud gateway**
(pay-per-use proxy with credit billing — see below). The choice is a
radio toggle when you create the workspace.

## Pay-per-use gateway (alternative to BYOK)

For users who don't want to manage Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini
accounts, thClaws.cloud offers a **gateway**: top up credits once,
then call any model through `gateway.thclaws.cloud/<provider>/...`
with a `gw_v1_…` token. The gateway forwards to upstream, meters the
response, and debits your balance.

To use the gateway from a **desktop** thClaws:

1. Mint a gateway access key in the catalog UI: **/gateway/keys** →
   *Mint new gateway key* → copy the `gw_v1_…` string.
2. Top up: **/credit** → pick a pack ($5 / $20 / $100). Bonus credit
   on the larger packs.
3. Configure thClaws to point at the gateway:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=gw_v1_…
   export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://thclaws.cloud/gateway/anthropic
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=gw_v1_…
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://thclaws.cloud/gateway/openai/v1
   # …same for GEMINI_*, OPENROUTER_*
   ```
   (Or set the matching `*_API_KEY` / `*_BASE_URL` fields in the GUI
   Settings → Providers panel.)
4. Run thClaws normally. Calls go via the gateway; spend lands in
   **/credit/usage**.

For **hosted** workspaces, the gateway is auto-wired when you pick
*Gateway* at workspace-create time — the runner gets the env vars
injected, no copy-paste needed.

### Credit is the only gate

There is **no model-tier ladder** — the old `starter`/`pro`/`enterprise`
gating was dropped. **Positive credit balance ⇒ any active model is
callable**; a `402 Payment Required` only fires when your balance hits
`0`. The price differential does the rest: a heavy Opus turn simply costs
more per call than Haiku, so expensive models naturally burn credit
faster. (`model_pricing.tier` still exists but is display-only — it sorts
the pricing page, it doesn't block anything.)

## Shared agents (one company agent, many people)

A **shared agent** is a single company-owned agent that several people
use at once — think a support bot, an internal research assistant, or
an onboarding helper that the whole team should share *without* each
person re-installing or re-configuring it. Shared agents are a
**hosted-cloud** feature (they run as hosted workspaces, not on your
laptop), managed from the **Dashboard → Shared agents** panel.

How it's structured:

- **One read-only company "brain", many private workspaces.** The
  owner uploads the agent's brain — `AGENTS.md`, the company KMS,
  skills, slash commands, and `mcp.json` (tool *config*, never
  credentials). Every member's workspace mounts that brain
  **read-only** and composes it in. Each member still gets their own
  private space: their chat history, their files, their own additive
  KMS, and their own MCP logins — none of which is visible to other
  members or the owner.
- **Locked to the company setup.** In shared mode the engine takes
  instructions **only** from the company `AGENTS.md` (a member's own
  `AGENTS.md` / `~/.config` / `~/.claude` are ignored), and the model
  can be pinned by the owner. This keeps every member on the same
  agent.
- **Gateway-only, owner pays.** Shared agents have no BYOK and no
  `.env` — all inference goes through the thClaws.cloud gateway and is
  billed to the **owner**. The owner sets a **per-member daily
  spend cap** (cents, resets each UTC day) on top of a workspace-wide
  daily cap; a member who hits their cap is blocked until it
  resets, so one person can't run up the whole bill.
- **Read-only means fork to customize.** A member can't edit the
  shared brain or write to the company KMS — those return a clear
  "shared KMS is read-only — fork to edit" message. To tailor it,
  **fork** the shared agent into your own private agent (a normal
  catalog agent you own and can change freely).

From the **Dashboard**, the Shared agents panel separates agents
**you own** (where you manage members, caps, brain upload, and see
usage) from agents **shared with you** (which you just launch and
use). The owner adds members by handle, sets each member's cap,
uploads or refreshes the brain (`brain.tgz` containing `AGENTS.md`,
`kms`, `skills`, `commands`, `mcp.json` — or builds it from an
existing agent), and watches per-member spend in the usage breakdown.

## Quick reference

All catalog ops happen inside an open thClaws session — every old
`thclaws cloud …` CLI form prints an error pointing at the
slash-command equivalent.

| Command | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Settings → **thClaws.cloud** | GUI | Cloud URL + CLI token (paste / clear). The only path for login/logout. |
| `/cloud status` | In-session slash | Show resolved URL + token state |
| `/cloud list [--mine]` | In-session slash | Browse the catalog |
| `/cloud get <slug>` | In-session slash | Install into the session's cwd (aborts on a non-empty/mismatched folder) |
| `/cloud publish` | In-session slash | Upload the session's cwd |
| `/cloud unbind` | In-session slash | Clear `agent.uuid` so the next publish creates a new catalog row |
| Settings → **Agent identity** | GUI | Edit this folder's `agent.name` / `description` |
| `/credit` (web) | Catalog UI | Top up + view balance + browse pricing |
| `/gateway/keys` (web) | Catalog UI | Mint `gw_v1_…` access keys |
| `/credit/usage` (web) | Catalog UI | Per-call spend + per-workspace breakdown |

## What thClaws.cloud is not

A few things to set expectations:

- **Not a model host.** Catalog agents still call out to Anthropic /
  OpenAI / Gemini for inference — either via your own BYOK keys or
  via the cloud gateway as a billing proxy. thClaws.cloud doesn't
  train or serve LLMs itself.
- **Not session storage.** Conversation history stays in
  `./.thclaws/sessions/` on the machine that ran the agent. The cloud
  stores agent files, not conversations.
- **Not required.** Every chapter before this one works with no
  network at all. The cloud is additive — install thClaws, write
  `AGENTS.md`, and you have a useful agent without ever signing up.
