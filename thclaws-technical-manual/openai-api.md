# OpenAI-compatible API

`thclaws --serve` exposes an OpenAI Chat Completions–compatible API at
`/v1/*` alongside the existing webapp. Any client that speaks the
OpenAI ecosystem can drive thClaws: openai-python, LiteLLM, LangChain,
Cursor's custom OpenAI provider, Aider, n8n, Open WebUI, etc.

The webapp + WebSocket are unchanged; the OpenAI surface is additive.

> **Note**: this endpoint is the **external-client surface**. It exposes
> thClaws as a model-shaped endpoint — request bodies don't carry
> skills, MCP servers, plugins, or workspace context, so callers can't
> inject those things. For *orchestrators* (custom schedulers, CI,
> your own control plane) that want skill / MCP / plugin
> injection per request, use the agent-shaped
> [`POST /agent/run`](agent-endpoint.md) endpoint instead. Both share
> the same `--serve` listener and `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` auth.

Source: [`crates/core/src/api_v1/`](../crates/core/src/api_v1/) +
the Router merge in [`server.rs`](../crates/core/src/server.rs).
Companion smoke tests: [`tests/openai_compat/`](../tests/openai_compat/).

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Start the server with an API token
THCLAWS_API_TOKEN=secret-pick-your-own \
  thclaws --serve --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 7878

# 2. From any OpenAI-compatible client:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-pick-your-own" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with OK"}]
     }' \
  http://127.0.0.1:7878/v1/chat/completions
```

The server still needs a real LLM key in its environment (e.g.
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) to talk to the upstream model —
it's the operator's responsibility to provide that, same as for
`thclaws -p` print mode.

## Endpoints

### `GET /v1/models`

List every model id thClaws knows how to route to, sourced from the
embedded model catalogue (no network call).

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:7878/v1/models
```

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1747449617,
      "owned_by": "anthropic",
      "context_window": 200000,
      "pricing": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "input_per_mtok": 3.0,
        "output_per_mtok": 15.0,
        "cached_input_per_mtok": 0.3,
        "cache_creation_per_mtok": 3.75
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "claude-haiku-4-5",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1747449617,
      "owned_by": "anthropic",
      "context_window": 200000,
      "pricing": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "input_per_mtok": 1.0,
        "output_per_mtok": 5.0,
        "cached_input_per_mtok": 0.1,
        "cache_creation_per_mtok": 1.25
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`owned_by` is the provider name as the catalogue records it
(`anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `gemini`, `dashscope`, etc).
Non-chat models (embeddings, audio, image-only) are filtered out so the
list matches what `/v1/chat/completions` can actually serve.

#### `context_window`

Optional. Maximum total tokens (prompt + completion) the model
accepts. Sourced from the model catalogue
([`model-catalogue.md`](model-catalogue.md)); omitted when the
catalogue hasn't recorded it for a given id.

#### `pricing`

Optional. USD-denominated rates from the model catalogue. dev-
plan/24 made this the canonical discovery surface for any client
that needs to estimate cost — n8n nodes, Zapier integrations,
custom dashboards, any client with a live-refresh path.

Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `currency` | Always `"USD"`. Orchestrators handle FX downstream. |
| `input_per_mtok` | USD per 1M uncached prompt tokens. |
| `output_per_mtok` | USD per 1M completion tokens. |
| `cached_input_per_mtok` | USD per 1M cache-READ tokens (Anthropic cache_read, OpenAI cached-input). Falls back to `input_per_mtok` when absent. |
| `cache_creation_per_mtok` | USD per 1M cache-WRITE tokens (Anthropic cache_creation; OpenAI auto-manages, leaves this `null`). |
| `reasoning_per_mtok` | USD per 1M o1/o3 hidden reasoning tokens, when the provider bills them separately. Most fold into output — field omitted there. |
| `tier_billed` | `true` for subscription-bundled models (Codex via ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team). Per-token math doesn't reflect actual billing — clients should show "tier-billed" instead of a $ amount. |
| `free` | `true` for free-tier models (OpenRouter free passes). Cost compute returns 0. |

The entire `pricing` object is omitted when the catalogue entry has
no pricing signal at all (un-curated model). Clients should fall back
to "Cost unavailable" rather than assuming $0 — see the
[catalogue doc](model-catalogue.md) for the curation workflow.

**Important — thClaws does NOT emit `cost_usd` on the chat-
completions response or callback payload.** Consumers compute cost
locally using these pricing rates × the token counts shipped on the
usage block (see [`/v1/chat/completions`](#post-v1chatcompletions)
below). That keeps the wire surface OpenAI-compatible and lets
orchestrators apply markup / FX / credits at their own billing edge.

### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

OpenAI Chat Completions. Supports both non-streaming (returns JSON) and
streaming (`stream: true` → Server-Sent Events).

**Honored request fields**

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | yes | Routed via `ProviderKind::detect` |
| `messages` | yes | Last `user`-role message becomes the turn prompt; everything before is history; `system` messages append to thClaws's default system prompt |
| `stream` | no | `false` → JSON, `true` → SSE |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop` | no | Forwarded to the underlying model when supported |
| `user` | no | Logged for audit |

**Silently ignored** (matches OpenAI's tolerance for unknown fields):
`tools`, `tool_choice`, `response_format`, `seed`, `logit_bias`,
`logprobs`, `top_logprobs`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`,
`n`, `stream_options`.

**Non-stream response**

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-thc-6a09...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1747449617,
  "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": "OK" },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 328,
    "completion_tokens": 4,
    "total_tokens": 332,
    "cached_input_tokens": 256,
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 72,
    "reasoning_output_tokens": 0
  }
}
```

The `usage` block is a SUPERSET of the standard OpenAI shape. The
three extra fields (`cached_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_
tokens`, `reasoning_output_tokens`) are dev-plan/24 additions —
optional, omitted when the provider didn't surface them, and ignored
by strict-OpenAI clients. Consumers compute cost via `pricing` rates
× these counts; see [`/v1/models`](#get-v1models) and
[`model-catalogue.md`](model-catalogue.md). Field semantics:

- `cached_input_tokens` — subset of `prompt_tokens` that hit a
  read-cache (Anthropic cache_read, OpenAI prompt_tokens_details
  .cached_tokens). The remainder pays the standard `input_per_mtok`
  rate.
- `cache_creation_input_tokens` — new tokens WRITTEN to cache this
  turn (Anthropic charges a write premium; OpenAI auto-manages and
  leaves this absent).
- `reasoning_output_tokens` — o1/o3 hidden reasoning tokens. ALREADY
  INCLUDED in `completion_tokens` per OpenAI's convention; broken
  out separately so consumers that bill reasoning at a distinct rate
  (`reasoning_per_mtok`) can subtract.

`thClaws does NOT include cost_usd on the response.` Cost computation
is the consumer's responsibility — fetch `/v1/models` pricing and
compute it yourself.

**Stream response (SSE)**

```
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-thc-...","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":...,
       "model":"...","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant"},
       "finish_reason":null}]}

data: {... ,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Looking at "},
       "finish_reason":null}]}

data: {... ,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"your project..."},
       "finish_reason":null}]}

data: {... ,"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"finish_reason":"stop"}],
       "usage":{"prompt_tokens":1234,"completion_tokens":567,
                "total_tokens":1801,"cached_input_tokens":1024,
                "cache_creation_input_tokens":48}}

data: [DONE]
```

The final chunk's `usage` block mirrors the non-stream response —
same field set, same `cost_usd`-free policy. The extra token counts
only appear in the terminal chunk; intermediate `chat.completion.chunk`
events don't carry usage data.

A `:keepalive` SSE comment is sent every 15s during long agent thinks
so HTTP proxies don't drop the connection. Spec-compliant SSE parsers
(openai-python, LiteLLM) ignore comments automatically.

### Tool-use events (extension)

When the agent invokes one of its internal tools (Bash, Read, Write,
KMS, etc.) during a streaming response, thClaws emits an
`x_thclaws_tool_use` field on otherwise-empty chunks:

```json
{
  "id": "...", "object": "chat.completion.chunk", "created": ...,
  "model": "...",
  "choices": [{"index": 0, "delta": {}, "finish_reason": null}],
  "x_thclaws_tool_use": {
    "id": "tu_abc",
    "name": "Bash",
    "status": "started",
    "input": {"command": "echo hi"}
  }
}
```

Status progression:

| `status` | Fields | When |
|---|---|---|
| `started` | `id`, `name`, `status`, `input` | Agent decided to run the tool |
| `completed` | `id`, `name`, `status`, `output` | Tool returned successfully |
| `error` | `id`, `name`, `status`, `output` | Tool returned an error |
| `denied` | `id`, `name`, `status` | An `ApprovalSink` rejected the call |

`output` is `{preview, truncated, total_chars}` — preview is the first
~400 chars (boundary-safe for UTF-8), `total_chars` is the full byte
count, `truncated` is `true` when preview was cut. Clients that need
the full output should re-run the tool directly or call
`/v1/chat/completions` non-stream.

`x_thclaws_tool_use` is non-standard OpenAI. Strict clients that parse
only documented fields ignore it cleanly; aware clients render the
tool-call timeline live.

## Authentication

Auth is controlled by the `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` environment variable on
the server, with three modes:

| `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` value | API state |
|---|---|
| unset or empty | `/v1/*` returns 404 — API disabled |
| `<value>` | Every `/v1/*` request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <value>` |
| literal string `disable-auth` | No auth check. **Refused** unless the listener is loopback-bound — startup errors otherwise |

Tokens are compared in constant time so timing-based extraction
attempts don't leak partial matches.

For SaaS / multi-tenant deployments: mint a unique token per tenant
pod and pass it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` from the consumer.
Token rotation = restart the pod with a new env value.

## Error responses

All errors use the OpenAI envelope shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key. Set THCLAWS_API_TOKEN on the server, then send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "invalid_api_key"
  }
}
```

| HTTP | `error.type` | `error.code` | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_request_error` | `invalid_messages` | `messages` array empty or no user message |
| 401 | `invalid_request_error` | `invalid_api_key` | Missing / wrong Bearer token |
| 404 | (text body) | — | `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` unset on server |
| 500 | `server_error` | `internal_error` | Upstream provider, network, or tool failure |

Errors that happen MID-SSE-STREAM (after headers flush) can't return a
new HTTP status. Instead the stream emits a final content chunk
prefixed with `[thclaws error] <message>` and a `finish_reason: "error"`
terminal chunk, then `[DONE]`. Clients see the error inline.

## Working directory

`thclaws --serve` runs against a single working directory (the process
cwd, or `--workspace <dir>` if specified). Every chat request uses the
same directory — file edits made by tool calls in one request are
visible to the next request's tool calls. The pod's filesystem **is**
the long-lived agent memory; the OpenAI API itself is stateless per
the standard `messages: [...]` convention.

For multi-tenant SaaS where each customer should have isolated state,
run one `thclaws --serve` per tenant (one container each), with the
customer's working directory mounted as a volume.

## Client examples

### openai-python SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:7878/v1",
    api_key="secret-pick-your-own",
)

# Non-stream
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-haiku-4-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)

# Streaming
for chunk in client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-haiku-4-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell a joke"}],
    stream=True,
):
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
```

### LiteLLM

```python
import litellm

resp = litellm.completion(
    model="openai/claude-haiku-4-5",   # `openai/` prefix uses OpenAI-compat client
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    api_base="http://localhost:7878/v1",
    api_key="secret-pick-your-own",
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Aider

```sh
aider --openai-api-base http://localhost:7878/v1 \
      --openai-api-key secret-pick-your-own \
      --model openai/claude-haiku-4-5 \
      file.py
```

### Cursor

Settings → Models → Override OpenAI Base URL = `http://localhost:7878/v1`,
API Key = your `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN`. Models in the dropdown match what
`/v1/models` returns.

## Async mode (`x_callback` extension)

For agentic loops that run minutes or hours, holding an SSE connection
open is a poor fit — proxies idle-timeout, the client process may die,
and a single dropped chunk wastes everything done so far. thClaws
ships an OpenAI-style request extension that opts an individual call
into **fire-and-forget + final webhook delivery**: thClaws ACKs with
202 Accepted, runs the agentic loop in the background, and delivers
the terminal result with one HTTP POST to a URL the client supplied.

The wire format is backward-compatible. Clients that don't know about
`x_callback` (Cursor, Aider, openai-python, LiteLLM, Cline) never
trigger the async path. Any client that wants async opts in per-call.

### Request shape

Send a standard `/v1/chat/completions` body with an extra `x_callback`
object:

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions
Authorization: Bearer <THCLAWS_API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
  "x_callback": {
    "url":     "https://my-orchestrator.example.com/webhooks/thclaws",
    "api_key": "<bearer the receiver will verify>",
    "run_id":  "<correlation id echoed back in the callback body>",
    "idempotency_key": "<optional; defaults to run_id>"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | string | yes | http or https. thClaws POSTs the terminal result here. |
| `api_key` | string | yes | thClaws sends `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` on the callback. Opaque to thClaws — the receiver verifies. |
| `run_id` | string | yes | Echoed verbatim in the callback body. Correlation id for the receiver. |
| `idempotency_key` | string | no | Sent as `Idempotency-Key` header on the callback POST. Defaults to `run_id`. |

The `stream` flag in the body is **ignored** when `x_callback` is set —
the call always goes async.

### Response: 202 Accepted

```json
{
  "run_id": "<the run_id you sent>",
  "status": "accepted",
  "model": "<resolved model id>"
}
```

The only sync error mode is 400 Bad Request on validation failure
(missing required field, malformed URL, non-http scheme). Once you see
202, the next signal you get is the callback POST.

### Callback POST shape

When the agent run terminates (success / error / cancel), thClaws POSTs
once to `x_callback.url`:

```http
POST <x_callback.url>
Authorization: Bearer <x_callback.api_key>
Content-Type: application/json
Idempotency-Key: <x_callback.idempotency_key OR x_callback.run_id>
User-Agent: thclaws/<version>

{
  "run_id":        "<x_callback.run_id>",
  "status":        "succeeded" | "failed" | "cancelled",
  "finish_reason": "stop" | "length" | "tool_calls" | "error",
  "model":         "<resolved model>",
  "summary":       "<final assistant text, may be empty for tool-only outcomes>",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens":              <n>,
    "completion_tokens":          <n>,
    "total_tokens":               <n>,
    "cached_input_tokens":        <n>,  // optional, omitted if absent
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": <n>, // optional, omitted if absent
    "reasoning_output_tokens":    <n>   // optional, omitted if absent
  },
  "tool_calls":   ["Read", "Bash", ...],
  "tool_denials": [],
  "iterations":   <n>,
  "error":        null | { "code": "<thclaws error code>", "message": "..." },
  "started_at":   "<ISO8601>",
  "completed_at": "<ISO8601>"
}
```

Detailed per-event tool-use payloads (input blobs, output previews) are
intentionally omitted from the terminal callback — they're available
on the synchronous SSE path. The async payload is a summary, not a
transcript.

`No cost_usd field.` Same convention as the sync response — the
receiver computes cost from `usage` × pricing fetched from `/v1/models`
(or a locally-bundled snapshot of it).

### Retry policy

thClaws retries the callback up to **3 times** at `t=0s`, `t=10s`,
`t=60s`, hard-capped at 90 seconds wall-clock. Retry triggers:

- 5xx response
- 429 response
- Any network / transport error

Gives-up triggers (1 attempt only):

- 4xx other than 429
- Successful 2xx response

After exhaustion, thClaws logs `event=callback_failed` and drops the
run. The receiver is responsible for reconciliation — typically via a
"silent run" timeout sweep that flags runs whose callback never landed.

### Authentication

- The **inbound** `/v1/chat/completions` is authenticated by
  `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` as usual.
- The **outbound** callback uses whatever `x_callback.api_key` the
  client supplied. thClaws never inspects it.
- Recommended receiver pattern: mint a **short-lived JWT** with
  `run_id` baked into the claims and verify both signature and
  `run_id`-vs-path on the callback handler. A leaked token then can't
  forge a completion for a different run.

### Telemetry

Each async run emits these structured log events to stderr:

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `callback_accepted` | 202 returned, async task spawned |
| `callback_delivered` | A retry attempt got a 2xx — done |
| `callback_retried` | A retry attempt failed; another is scheduled |
| `callback_failed` | All retries exhausted, run dropped |

### When to use async mode

Use `x_callback` when:

- The run is expected to take **>5 minutes** (agentic loops, multi-tool
  workflows, long builds)
- The client can't reliably hold an SSE connection (Lambda, GitHub
  Actions step, cron job, Slack bot)
- You're integrating with a webhook-style automation tool (n8n, Zapier,
  Make.com)
- You want **decoupled lifetimes** between client and run (client may
  restart while run continues)

Stay on the sync SSE path (no `x_callback`) when:

- The user is watching token-by-token output (chat UIs)
- The run is fast (<60s) and you want the result inline
- You don't have a public HTTP endpoint to receive a callback

### Worked example (curl)

```sh
# Terminal 1: stand up a one-shot callback receiver
nc -l 8901 &

# Terminal 2: dispatch async
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:7878/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THCLAWS_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "list 3 files in /tmp"}],
    "x_callback": {
      "url":     "http://localhost:8901/cb",
      "api_key": "test-receiver-secret",
      "run_id":  "demo-run-001"
    }
  }'
# → 202 with { "run_id": "demo-run-001", "status": "accepted", ... }
```

A minute or two later (depending on the model), the netcat listener
prints the terminal callback POST.

## Limits and non-goals

This is **Chat Completions only** — by design.

| Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | ✅ |
| `GET /v1/models` | ✅ |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | ❌ Not planned. Use the underlying provider directly. |
| `POST /v1/audio/*` | ❌ Not planned. |
| `POST /v1/images/*` | ❌ Not planned. |
| Assistants v2 | ❌ Not planned — thClaws's agent runtime IS the assistant. |
| Batch / fine-tuning | ❌ Not planned. |
| Client-driven function calling (`tools`/`tool_choice`) | ❌ Internal tools only. thClaws decides when to call them; clients see results via the `x_thclaws_tool_use` extension. |
| `n != 1` multi-response | ❌ Returns 400. |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `404` on `/v1/*` | `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` not set on server |
| `401 invalid_api_key` | Bearer header missing or doesn't match `THCLAWS_API_TOKEN` |
| Server refuses to start with "THCLAWS_API_TOKEN=disable-auth is only allowed on a loopback bind" | Bind to `127.0.0.1` or set a real token |
| Streaming returns 200 but no content | Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / equivalent is set in the server's env — without it, the upstream LLM call fails and you'll see `[thclaws error]` in the stream |
| Long agent runs time out before completion | Increase the timeout on your HTTP client (openai-python defaults to 600s, often enough; LiteLLM has its own knobs) |
