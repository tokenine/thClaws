//! Boot a `LineSession` from a stored `LineConfig` and own its
//! lifetime for the worker.
//!
//! Phase 2: replaces the Phase-1.3 placeholder `EchoHandler` with
//! `WorkerForwardHandler`, which routes each inbound LINE message
//! into the worker's `ShellInput::LineMessage` channel. The worker
//! drives `Agent::run_turn`, captures the final assistant text,
//! and answers via a `oneshot::Sender`; this handler returns that
//! captured text so the existing `LineSession::SessionSink` posts
//! the LINE reply unchanged.
//!
//! `LineSessionHandle` is what the worker stashes — it bundles
//! the cancel token (for `/disconnect`) with a status snapshot
//! the IPC layer can render.
