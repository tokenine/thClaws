# Chapter 28 — Browser automation

Give your agent a real web browser. thClaws drives a full Chromium
through Microsoft's official **Playwright MCP** server — the agent
navigates, clicks, fills forms, reads pages, and runs JavaScript-heavy
sites the way a person would, not by guessing pixel coordinates. You
get a **Browser** tab to watch it work, take over to log in yourself,
and hand control back. Built across v0.48–v0.52.

This is the inverse of "computer use" screenshot tools: the agent works
from the page's **accessibility tree** (fast, reliable, cheap), and can
also *see* the rendered pixels when a page is visual-only.

## When to use it (vs. WebFetch)

thClaws already has `WebFetch` / `WebScrape` for pulling static pages.
Reach for the **browser** when fetch can't do the job:

- **Logged-in / authenticated** sites — you sign in once, the agent
  works inside your session.
- **JavaScript-heavy** apps — SPAs, infinite scroll, content that only
  appears after interaction.
- **Forms and flows** — multi-step submissions, file uploads, dialogs.
- **"Fix this for me"** — the 12-gram pattern: you're stuck on a broken
  web form, you tell the agent "figure out why Submit is greyed out and
  send it," and it reads the HTML, JS, console, and network to do it.

For a one-shot read of a public article, `WebFetch` is lighter.

## Turning it on

Browser automation is **on by default** since v0.49.2 — every workspace
gets it with no configuration, as long as **Node.js (`npx`) is on your
PATH** (Playwright is a Node package).

To turn it off, or force headed/headless, set it in
`.thclaws/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "browserEnabled": false,        // opt out entirely
  "browserHeadless": true          // force headless even on desktop
}
```

- **Desktop default:** *headed* — a real Chromium window opens beside
  the app the first time the agent uses a browser tool. You can watch
  and interact with it directly.
- **Cloud default:** *headless* — there's no window on a runner, so the
  **Browser tab's live view is your window** (see below).

Nothing is downloaded until first use: Chromium launches **lazily** on
the first browser tool call, so an idle workspace pays nothing.

> **No Node?** On a machine without `npx`, the Browser tab shows a
> setup hint instead of erroring, and the agent simply runs without
> browser tools. Install Node.js (e.g. `brew install node`) and
> restart.

## The Browser tab

When browser automation is enabled, a **Browser** tab appears. It has
three parts:

**Status** — whether the managed browser is on, headed or headless, the
launch command, and a warning if the browser binary can't be found.

**Live view / screenshot** — the rendered page:

- On **cloud / headless**, this is a **live screencast** (a continuous
  video-like stream) once you enter takeover, so the headless browser
  has a real window after all.
- Otherwise it auto-captures a fresh **screenshot ~1 second after every
  browser action**, plus a manual **📷 capture** button. Visual-only
  content (canvases, charts) shows here even when the accessibility
  tree can't describe it.

**Activity feed** — every `browser_*` tool call and result streams in
with timestamps, plus live **console errors and page navigations** (so
you can see what the agent — or the page — is doing).

**Agent sidebar** — a compact chat docked on the right, the *same*
conversation as the Chat tab. Direct the agent without leaving the tab:
"log-in is done, take over and export the report." It accepts slash
commands too (`/clear`, etc.) and stays in sync with the other tabs.

## Taking over — log in yourself, then hand back

Some sites you have to log into personally (your bank, LinkedIn). Click
**🖱 Take over** and the live view becomes a remote control:

- **Click** anywhere on the page,
- **Scroll** with your mouse wheel,
- **Type** into the focused field (with quick **Enter / Tab / Esc / ⌫**
  keys), and
- a **URL bar + back button** to navigate.

Do your login, then tell the agent in the sidebar to continue. On
desktop you can also just use the headed Chromium window directly — the
agent shares the same browser, so whatever you do (sign in, accept a
cookie banner) is there when it takes over.

## Logins persist across restarts

The browser keeps a profile on disk, so **cookies and sessions survive**
browser restarts — and, on cloud, pod restarts and pauses. Log into a
site once and the agent stays logged in next time, without you
re-authenticating every session.

The profile lives **outside your workspace folder**, and is explicitly
stripped from agent publishing — so your cookies can never leak into an
agent you share on the catalog.

## Safety notes

- The browser runs with **your** privileges and (when you're logged in)
  **your** sessions. Treat it like handing the agent your browser:
  fine for trusted tasks, think twice before pointing it at sensitive
  accounts unattended.
- Browser tools are **mutating** — under `ask` permissions the agent
  asks before acting; under `auto` it just goes. See
  [Chapter 5 — Permissions](ch05-permissions.md).
- The takeover controls are **yours**, routed straight to the browser —
  they don't go through the agent or cost tokens.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Browser tab shows "command not found" | Install Node.js so `npx` is on PATH, then restart thClaws |
| No Browser tab at all | `browserEnabled` is `false` in settings.json, or Node isn't installed |
| Agent "can't see" a chart / canvas | Ask it to take a screenshot — it reads pixels via vision, not just the accessibility tree |
| Want zero windows on desktop | Set `"browserHeadless": true` |
| Logged out after a cloud pod restart | Fixed in v0.52.0 — update if you're older |

## Under the hood

For engineers: the engine owns the Chromium process and attaches
Playwright MCP to it via a DevTools endpoint, so the agent's tools and
your takeover drive **one** browser. Full internals — the
`browser_cdp` module, screencast, input, cookie snapshot/restore, and
the runner-image packaging — are in the technical manual's
[`browser.md`](../thclaws-technical-manual/browser.md).
