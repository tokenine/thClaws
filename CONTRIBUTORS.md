  Keep the MCP-App iframe alive across Fullscreen / PIP / Back-

- **PR [#33](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/33)** —

  `scripts/build.{sh,ps1}` build helpers.

### [@SalmonRK](https://github.com/SalmonRK)

  `ProviderKind::OpenAICompat` for generic OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints (LiteLLM, Portkey, Helicone, vLLM, internal proxies).

- **PR [#43](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/43)** —
  Implicit-thinking fix + Thai font fallbacks. Repaired the
  silent-thinking flow on providers that don't echo thinking
  events, and added Thai-script font fallbacks for the GUI.

### [@NuttapongPun](https://github.com/NuttapongPun) (Nuttapong Pungasem)
- **PR [#44](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/44)** — CLI

### [@Tanabat-Hamtaro](https://github.com/Tanabat-Hamtaro)
- **PR [#61](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/61)** —
  Escape `\u2028`, `\u2029`, and `\0` in `escape_for_js` so
  JSON-in-JS injections survive line-separator and null bytes.

### [@supakornkim](https://github.com/supakornkim) (Supakorn Kimhajan)

  userid handling when running in a container.
- **PR [#147](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/147)** —

### [@nazt](https://github.com/nazt) (Nat)
- **PR [#88](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/88)** — Added
  the ChatGPT-subscription Codex provider — backbone of the later
  `chatgpt-codex` integration.

### [@baslenvm](https://github.com/baslenvm)
- **PR [#103](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/103)** —
  OpenCodeGo: deduct cached tokens from `input_tokens` so cost
  accounting matches the underlying billing.

### [@dome](https://github.com/dome) (Dome C.)
- **PR [#110](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/110)
  (closed → adopted into [#113](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/113))** —
  Make `--model` flag actually work across CLI, GUI, and serve
  modes. The original PR was closed when @mozeal opened the
  follow-up #113 incorporating the fix; the merge commit
  ([a697cc2](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/commit/a697cc2))
  lists @dome as co-author so credit lands where the work was
  done.

### [@ultramcu](https://github.com/ultramcu) (MaIII Themd)
- **PR [#115](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/115)** —
  Surface prompt and cache token usage from `message_start` in the
  Anthropic stream.
- **PR [#120](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/120)** —
  Throttle LINE reconnect after a clean WebSocket close.
- **PR [#121](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/121)** —
  Reject an empty `old_string` in the Edit tool to prevent silent
  no-ops.

### [@modtanoii](https://github.com/modtanoii) (Chaiwat Chanavirat)
- **PR [#135](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/135)** — Helm
  chart for self-hosted Kubernetes deployment. First-class k8s
  install path beyond docker-compose.
- **PR [#137](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/137)** — Review
  follow-ups on the Helm chart.
- **PR [#140](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/140)** — Bump
  the MiniMax default to MiniMax-M3 to match the current api.minimax.io
  flagship.

### [@gobikom](https://github.com/gobikom)
- **PR [#139](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/139)** —
  Cap spinner line width to terminal columns. Stopped the REPL
  spinner from wrapping on narrow terminals.

### [@sc28249782](https://github.com/sc28249782) (Somchai Pongkasem)
- **Issue [#141](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/141)** —
  Reported, root-caused, AND tested a fix for the
  `split_shell_segments` UTF-8 panic. The fix proposal landed
  essentially as-is in v0.30.0. Exactly the kind of bug report that
  closes itself.

### [@minkbear](https://github.com/minkbear) (WJ)
- **PR [#146](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/146)** —
  Backfilled changelog sections for v0.21.0 → v0.33.0 that had
  been added without changelog entries during a fast-iteration
  stretch.

### [@JonusNattapong](https://github.com/JonusNattapong) (Dek1milliontoken)
- **PR [#153](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/153)** — Reset
  `cursorPos` on terminal line-clear events. Two paths cleared
  `lineBuffer` without resetting the cursor (slash-popup Escape +
  engine `terminal_clear`), so the caret drifted off the buffer.
  Clean 2-line fix matching the existing Ctrl+C handler pattern.
  Shipped in v0.42.0.
- **PR [#157](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/pull/157)** —
  Escape `</` in injected values to prevent HTML script breakout in
  the gui-shell bridge. A malicious shell manifest could plant
  `</script>` in its `id` and break out of the injected
  `<script>` tag; the canonical `<\/` replacement neutralises it.
  Defence-in-depth on hosted-cloud / `--serve` surfaces and any
  future gui-shell marketplace.

### [@pok29dev](https://github.com/pok29dev)
- **Issue [#156](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/156)** —
  Reported the DashScope picker double-prefix bug
  (`dashscope/dashscope/<model>`) and pinned the expected canonical
  shape (`dashscope/<model>`). That pointer drove the fix in v0.44.0:
  DashScope routing now follows the same `dashscope/` prefix pattern
  as `zai/` / `qc/` / `ap/` — strip on the wire, keep canonical in
  the catalogue + picker.

### [@mgprona](https://github.com/mgprona)
- **Issue [#162](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/162)** —
  Requested first-class TokenRouter support and pinned the integration
  shape (OpenAI-compatible, `tokenrouter/*` prefix, base
  `api.tokenrouter.com/v1`). Shipped in v0.60.0 as a dedicated
  `tokenrouter/` provider + catalogue, beyond the generic `oai/` slot.

### [@Mayth01](https://github.com/Mayth01)
- **Issue [#163](https://github.com/thClaws/thClaws/issues/163)** —
  Three precisely-diagnosed serve + team-mode bugs on Linux: dropped
  text deltas from an undersized `ViewEvent` broadcast channel, the
  `pkill --team-dir` getopt failure, and an HTTP 400 on reasoning-only
  turns — each with a root cause and a tested fix. Applied in v0.60.0;
  a model bug report.

Be courteous in discussions, follow the existing style of the file
you're editing, and keep PRs small + scoped. CI must be green
before merge.
