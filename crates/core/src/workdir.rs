//! dev-plan/42: per-session working-directory chokepoint.
//!
//! In multiuser `--serve` (one pod, a `workspace-<id>/` per user) many
//! sessions share one process, so the agent's working directory must
//! NOT come from the process-global `std::env::current_dir()` — that's a
//! single mutable global racing across tenants (a `set_current_dir` on
//! one user's turn would relocate another user's in-flight path
//! resolution; see dev-plan/42 §Security). Each worker establishes a
//! task-local working root around its agent run, and every path-resolving
//! tool reads it through [`current_workdir`].
//!
//! A `tokio::task_local!` (not a `thread_local!`) is required because
//! each worker runs its own *multi-threaded* runtime, so a tool future
//! can resume on a different runtime thread after an `.await`; a
//! task-local follows the task across those hops, a thread-local would
//! not.
//!
//! Single-tenant `--serve`, desktop, and CLI never enter the scope, so
//! [`current_workdir`] falls back to `std::env::current_dir()` —
//! behaviour unchanged. In multiuser the worker always establishes the
//! scope, so process cwd is never consulted (fail-closed).
