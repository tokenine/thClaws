//! GUI Shell subsystem — domain-specific HTML frontends served as
//! sandboxed iframes inside the desktop GUI (Mode A) or as the bound
//! frontend in `--serve` mode (Mode B, Tier 2).
//!
//! Tier 1 scope: embedded built-in shells only, single hardcoded entry
//! in the GUI's new-tab menu, bridge surface limited to
//! `run` / `cancel` / `on("text"|"done"|"error")`. See
//! `dev-plan/33-gui-shell.md` for the full roadmap.
